# Architectural Pattern
 With Design Pattern, now we could develop an application more effitively than before. But, have you ever wondered that, Design Pattern just help to strucutre a library, so what would structure something bigger, like systems or frameworks? 

Yeah, the answer is `Architectural patterns`. There is a lot of confusion around that what is difference between Architectural pattern and Design pattern, so I just show you my opinion about this topic.

## What's an Architectural Pattern?
- By Wikipedia : 
    An __architectural pattern__ is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.
    The architectural patterns address various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance limitations, high availability and minimization of a business risk. 

So unclear!
- I think the best definition of __architectural pattern__ that `an architectural pattern is a design pattern but has ability to solve more problems than one ordinary. It can implement many design pattern inside it.`

## What's the difference?
- __Architectural Patterns__ are broader in scope than __Design Patterns__. 
> + __Design Patterns__ provide very specific software related tasks whereas __Architectural Patterns__ are solutions for business problems.
> + __Architectural Pattern__ focuses more on the abstract view of idea while __Design Patterns__ focuses on the implementation view of idea.

- Implementation of __Design Patterns__ are defined at granular level where as __Architectural Patterns__ are defined at high level. For example, different implementations of Factory and Builder pattern might look very similar in different projects. But same at Architectural Patterns can be varied a lot in different projects.

- One __Architectural Pattern__ can be implemented by using many __Design Patterns__. There is one to many relationship between __Architectural Patterns__ and __Design Patterns__.

## Popular Architectural Patterns
- There are many popular architectural patterns (by formal documentation and by team developer rule ...). In this article, I will make a brief introduction about 4 most common architectural patterns : 

1. Client - Server 
- The easiest pattern for understand and implement. 2 parties (1 server and multi clients) interact through a safe connection (almost TCP/IP, network). 
- Advantage : using authorized access, client access via "UI" without commandline, distributed model, easy maintainmance.
- Disadvantage : overload server, make "single point of failure".
- Popular in online application (email, share file, ...)

2. MVC

[Model-View-Controller, legendary architecture pattern](./Mvc.md)

3. N-Layer Pattern
- Decompose programs into group of subtasks (Layer). Each layer provides services to the next higher layer.
- Most common type is 3-tier architect :
> + Presentation layer (UI) : make UI and of logic UI.
> + Business logic layer (Service) : responsible for all logic of the instruction. 
> + Data access layer (DA) : interact with database at below.
- Advantage : easy for maintain, manage large-scale product
- Disadvantage : Code logic is large; tasks only passing data must go through Service layer, make lower performance
- Popular in desktop app, web-app of commerce company.

4. MVVM
- A higher refinement of MVC, which Controller is replaced by View-Model. The specification of this pattern is the Flow one-way, which mean only View "know" about VM, and only VM "know" about Model.  
- Advantage : Easy unit-test; communitation between designer and developer; develop product fast, easy scale-up and maintainmance.
- Disadvantage : lower performance for small and ordinary applications; cost time for develop a good VM for larger applications.

## Conclustion
- Architectural Patterns is useful for many tasks when develop "big-case" applications. If you want to become a better engineer, let explore about it, you will see a big impact on your mindset.
